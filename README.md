# project-1

Name:  Jordan Woodard

Overview:  This project is for a webpage that I made.  It is for a fictional company set in the year 2185, which is conducting space tours for people who live on Earth, taking them to different planets across the galaxy.

How to use:  The webpage is divided into three segments:  Summary, Tour, and Registration.  It is possible to explore these parts of the page by clicking on the links in the navbar.  The end of each segment features a link that reads "Go Back to Navbar" in italics, which takes the user back to the navbar.  There are also images placed within carousels, which show what these planets and their surfaces look like.  A validation form has been added as well, and whether the use fills it out correctly or not, a feedback message appears below each label whenever the user clicks the Submit button.

Technology used:  .html, .css

Ideas for future improvement:  set up navigation paths by using buttons, find an image large enough to cover the background instead of tiling a small image, try out more font variety
