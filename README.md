# project-1

Name:  Jordan Woodard

Overview:  This project is for a website that I made.  It is a fictional company set in the year 2185, which is conducting space tours for people who live on Earth, taking them to different planets across the galaxy.

How to use:  The webpage is divided into three segments:  Summary, Tour, and Registration.  It is possible to explore these parts of the page by clicking on the navbar.  There are also images placed within carousels, which show what these planets and their surfaces look like.  A validation form has been added as well, and whether the use fills it out correctly or not, a feedback message appears below each label.

Technology used:  .html, .css

Ideas for future improvement:  aligh the "First Name" and "Last Name" labels properly, find an image large enough to cover the background instead of tiling a small image, use more font variety
