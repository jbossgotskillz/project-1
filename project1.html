              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>Have you ever wondered what space travel feels like?  Do you look up at the stars and think about what (or who) lies beyond the solar system?  Are you tired of being stuck on the same rock every 
                day?  Then allow Astro Ex to help you satisfy your curiosity.  Whether you want to find a new world to colonize, plan on joining the military, are interested in meeting some alien races, or have a 
                taste for adventure, Astro Ex is here to fulfill your needs and desires.  So if you're ready to embark on a journey into the final frontier, then sign up for an Astro Ex Space Tour today!</p>
        </section>

             <h4>Purpose</h4>
             <p>Funded by an multinational space organization called the Human Advancement Coalition (or "HAC" for short), the Astro Ex corporation is in charge of its interstellar expansion efforts.  Basically, our job is 
              to map out other star systems and survey extrasolar worlds.  As humanity continues to expand across the galaxy, the Coalition needs to know which worlds are suitable for colonization, since each world 
              comes with its own surprises, and must prepare for whatever threats may lie ahead.  Based on Earth, our homeworld, Astro Ex has been supporting the Coalition since 2147.  Now we have been authorized by our
              employer to conduct space tours for Earth citizens who are willing to leave home, be it temporarily or permanently.</p>

            <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
            <p>The Astro Ex corporation is honored to provide Earth civilians with an opportunity to explore the cosmos.  We at Astro Ex understand that space travel is a dangerous venture.  There's always the threat
              of astromonical events like asteroids and supernovas, as well as hostile encounters with space pirates and criminal organizations, not to mention the possibility of going to war with other spacefaring.  
              races.  Nevertheless, we are proud to show you that space is also a marvelous venture.  Life is full of risks.  Besides, if humanity was too afraid to take risks, then we wouldn't have been trying to leave 
              Earth in the first place.</p>
