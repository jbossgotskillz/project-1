              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>Have you ever wondered what space travel feels like?  Do you look up at the stars and think about what (or who) lies beyond the solar system?  Are you tired of being stuck on the same rock every 
                day?  Then allow Astro Ex to help you satisfy your curiosity.  Whether you want to find a new world to colonize, plan on joining the military, are interested in meeting some alien races, or have a 
                taste for adventure, Astro Ex is here to fulfill your needs and desires.  So if you're ready to embark on a journey into the final frontier, then sign up for an Astro Ex Space Tour today!</p>

        <section class="col-12">
             <h4>Purpose</h4>
             <p>Funded by an multinational space organization called the Human Advancement Coalition (or "HAC" for short), the Astro Ex corporation is in charge of its interstellar expansion efforts.  Basically, our job is 
              to map out other star systems and survey extrasolar worlds.  As humanity continues to expand across the galaxy, the Coalition needs to know which worlds are suitable for colonization, since each world 
              comes with its own surprises, and must prepare for whatever threats may lie ahead.  Based on Earth, our homeworld, Astro Ex has been supporting the Coalition since 2147.  Now we have been authorized by our
              employer to conduct space tours for Earth citizens who are willing to leave home, be it temporarily or permanently.</p>

            <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
            <p>The Astro Ex corporation is honored to provide Earth civilians with an opportunity to explore the cosmos.  We at Astro Ex understand that space travel is a dangerous venture.  There's always the threat
              of astromonical events like asteroids and supernovas, as well as hostile encounters with space pirates and criminal organizations, not to mention the possibility of going to war with other spacefaring.  
              races.  Nevertheless, we are proud to show you that space is also a marvelous venture.  Life is full of risks.  Besides, if humanity was too afraid to take risks, then we wouldn't have been trying to leave 
              Earth in the first place.</p>

        <h4>List of Planets</h4>
        <p>As Astro Ex continues to discover new worlds, the stops along each tour are constantly changing.  Here is the list of the eight planets that have been scheduled for the next upcoming tour.</p>
    </div>

          <h2>ANUBIS</h2>
          
      <p>The planet Anubis is littered with barren wastelands.  Rocky canyons, mesas, and plateaus can be found all over the surface.  The presence of water beds and giant fossils provides a hint that prehistoric life once 
           thrived here.  Unfortunately, a climate shift caused by its sun killed off every living creature on the planet, rendering Anubis completely devoid of life.  It only makes sense to name this world after the Egyptian 
            god of death.  By now, the Coalition has developed an industrial hub on this lifeless rock, mainly for producing weapons, armor, robots, and starships for the military.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="col-12">
        <div class="text-center">
          <h2>BASTION</h2>

      <p>A planet located near the western border of Human Space, Bastion is covered in vast mountain ranges.  Lakes and rivers divide up the rocky mountains, and fog often blankets parts of the surface.  Predatory birds, 
        which nest high above the surface, dominate the food chain on Bastion, feasting on the animals below.  Realizing the strategic value that the mountains provide and its close proximity to alien territory, the 
        Coalition established a military base on Bastion, in case relations with one of the alien races from the west turns sour.</p>
      </section>

>
          <h2>EDEN</h2>

        <p>The picturesque world of Eden features grassy plains, as well as highlands and lakes.  It is a windy planet with a warm climate.  The plants and animals that can be found on Eden are relatively benign.  With its 
          calm weather and plentiful food sources, this planet has become known among the human race as a paradise world (just like its Christian namesake).  Not too long ago, the HAC transformed it into an agriculture center, 
          distributing food and water to nearby worlds in which such things are hard to come by.  The only real danger for Eden comes in the form of pirate attacks, as it is not very far from a lawless region of space to the 
          east.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="col-12">
 
          <h2>PACIFICO</h2>
 
        <p>Deriving its name from the Pacific Ocean back on Earth, Pacifico is a world covered in water.  98% of its surface is submerged under the ocean, while the other 2% is made up of island chains.  As expected, Pacifico 
          is home to a wide variety of marine creatures.  In addition, its tropical climate provides the ingredients for storms to develop on a regular basis.  When the Coalition found Pacifico, it decided to use it as a 
          communication hub, since it is placed alongside a trade route that runs through the southern side of Human Space.</p>
